# Testing the Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. "View in Canva" Context Menu Position
**Problem**: The context menu was appearing in the top-left corner instead of near the trigger button.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified `CustomContextMenu.tsx` to use `setTimeout` to ensure the menu content is rendered before calculating dimensions
- Added width/height of 0 to the Portal container to prevent it from interfering with positioning
- Added proper z-index to the three dots menu container

### 2. Distribute Button Not Working
**Problem**: The distribute button wasn't responding to clicks.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed conflicting `pointer-events` classes from the overlay div
- Added proper z-index values to ensure button is clickable
- Added `stopPropagation` to the three dots button to prevent event conflicts
- Added CSS rules to ensure all buttons in cards have `pointer-events: auto`

## Test Steps:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. Hover over any design card
3. Test the "View in Canva" functionality:
   - Click the three dots menu in the top-right corner
   - Verify the menu appears next to the button (not in top-left corner)
   - Click "View in Canva" and verify it opens in a new tab
4. Test the Distribute button:
   - Hover over a design card
   - Click the "Distribute Campaign" button that appears
   - Verify the distribute dialog opens
   - Test the "Continue to Campaign Setup" button

## Key Changes Made:

1. **CustomContextMenu.tsx**: Added setTimeout to defer position calculation
2. **Portal.tsx**: Set width/height to 0 to prevent layout interference
3. **DesignCard.tsx**: 
   - Removed conflicting pointer-events classes
   - Added proper z-index values
   - Added stopPropagation to prevent event bubbling
4. **settings-overrides.css**: Added rules to ensure buttons are always clickable
