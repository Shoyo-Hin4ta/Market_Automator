## ü§ñ Meet Your AI Team

Marketing Automator uses four specialized AI agents that work together to create your campaigns:

### Brand Agent
Handles the visual side of things - picks colors that work well together, suggests fonts, and ensures everything looks consistent with your brand.

### Content Agent
Your copywriter - creates headlines, writes compelling descriptions, and crafts calls-to-action that convert. It adapts the tone and style based on your campaign goals.

### Technical Agent
The builder - takes the design and content and turns them into actual emails and web pages. Handles all the HTML, CSS, and makes sure everything displays correctly.

### Orchestrator Agent
The project manager - coordinates the other agents, reviews their work, and suggests improvements. Makes sure everything works together seamlessly.
