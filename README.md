## ü§ñ Meet Your AI Team

Marketing Automator uses a multi-agent system to create your campaigns:

### Initial Campaign Creation
When you create a new campaign, four specialized agents work together:

**Orchestrator Agent** - The project manager that coordinates the team and ensures everything works together seamlessly.

**Brand Agent** - Handles colors, fonts, spacing, and visual consistency. Creates a cohesive design system for your campaign.

**Content Agent** - Your copywriter that creates headlines, body text, and calls-to-action. Adapts tone and messaging to your audience.

**Technical Agent** - Builds the actual HTML for emails and landing pages, ensuring everything displays correctly across devices.

### Campaign Refinement
When you want to make changes, a single **Refinement Agent** handles all updates:
- Understands natural language requests like "make the heading white" or "change the website background"
- Directly modifies the HTML without complex routing
- Automatically detects whether to update email, landing page, or both
